title: How I built my portfolio with Gatsby and ReactJS
---

For some time now, I've been looking for new web technologies to build my personal website. Since i'm already familiar with ReactJS, i started to look at lightweight ways using this technologies to make my website responsive, scalable and easy to keep updated and thatâ€™s exactly where Gatsby helps me.


#Create a Gatsby site

Gatsby allows you to build websites powered by the JAMStack architecture that uses JavaScript, APIs and Markup without requiring the use of a database or server-side programming language. Since it has the concept of starters you can pick from hundreds the one that matches your project, in my case it was [gatsby-starter-blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog/).

You only need two commands:

``` jsx
npm install -g gatsby-cli
gatsby new site-name https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
```


#Deploy to Netlify
Netlify is one of the best (if not the best) place to deploy your Gatsby site. And is super easy to do, just follow this steps.
